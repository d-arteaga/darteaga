                <strong>Music has always been a huge part of my life.</strong>
                <br></br>I play drums, guitar, bass, and a variety of percussion
                instruments, and I spent several years working as a studio
                musician. During that time, I performed everywhere from local
                clubs in Ventura and the Pasadena Civic Center to a boat parade
                in Oxnard. I even had the unique experience of performing at
                NAMM 2020 in Anaheim, CA, opening for{" "}
                <b>Tower&nbsp;of&nbsp;Power</b>. I was also the studio drummer
                of the jazz ensemble The&nbsp;Jazz&nbsp;Lawyers, contributing to
                the writing and recording of their debut album,{" "}

                Now, I play drums and guitar in my spare time and enjoy
                recording and mixing covers and tutorials to share online. Music
                continues to be a creative outlet for me, blending performance
                with production.

                In addition to my work as a musician, I have several years of
                experience as a video editor and content analyst, blending
                creativity with data-driven decision-making. I specialize in
                video and audio workflows, utilizing Ableton&nbsp;Live,
                Adobe&nbsp;Premiere&nbsp;Pro, Adobe&nbsp;After&nbsp;Effects, and
                Photopea to produce high-quality content.
                <br /> I personally oversee and manage two separate content
                businesses, handling everything from editing and post-production
                to branding and audience engagement strategies. Beyond editing,
                I take a data-driven approach to content performance, analyzing
                various metrics using Python to optimize audience retention,
                engagement, and growth. By leveraging data analytics, I refine
                content strategies, improve video pacing, and enhance
                storytelling to maximize impact.{" "}

                  Outside of music and video editing, I enjoy staying active and
                  exploring the outdoors. Whether it’s hiking through National
                  Parks like <i>Yosemite</i> and <i>Sequoia</i>, relaxing at the
                  beach, or discovering new botanical gardens, I love immersing
                  myself in nature whenever I can. I’m also passionate about
                  fitness and working out, seeing it as both a challenge and a
                  way to stay balanced and healthy. <br></br>
                  Another fun fact about me—I speak three languages: English,
                  Spanish, and Japanese! Learning new languages has given me a
                  deeper appreciation for different cultures and perspectives,
                  and I enjoy finding new ways to connect with people through
                  language and shared experiences.
                  <br />I believe in continuous learning and pushing creative
                  boundaries, whether in music, technology, or personal growth.
