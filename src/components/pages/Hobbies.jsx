                <strong>Music has always been a huge part of my life.</strong>
                <br></br>I play drums, guitar, bass, and a variety of percussion
                instruments, and I spent several years working as a studio
                musician. During that time, I performed everywhere from local
                clubs in Ventura, CA; the Pasadena Civic Center in Pasadena, CA;
                on a boat for a parade in Oxnard, CA; and even had the unique
                experience of performing at NAMM 2020 in Anaheim, CA, opening
                for <b>Tower&nbsp;of&nbsp;Power</b>. I was also the studio
                drummer of the jazz ensemble The&nbsp;Jazz&nbsp;Lawyers,
                contributing to the writing and recording of their debut album,{" "}

                Now, I play drums and guitar in my spare time and enjoy
                recording and mixing covers and creating tutorials to share
                online. Music continues to be a creative outlet for me, blending
                performance with production.

                  In addition to my work as a musician, I have several years of
                  experience as a video editor and content analyst, combining
                  creativity with data-driven decision-making. I specialize in
                  video and audio workflows, utilizing Ableton&nbsp;Live,
                  Adobe&nbsp;Premiere&nbsp;Pro, Adobe After&nbsp;Effects, and
                  Photopea to produce high-quality content across various
                  platforms.
                  <br></br>I personally oversee and manage two separate content
                  businesses, handling everything from editing and
                  post-production to branding and audience engagement
                  strategies. Beyond editing, I take a data-driven approach to
                  content performance, analyzing various metrics from my channel
                  and video data using Python to optimize audience retention,
                  engagement, and growth. <br />
                  By leveraging data analytics, I refine content strategies,
                  improve video pacing, and enhance storytelling to maximize
                  impact.{" "}

                  Outside of music and video editing, I enjoy staying active and
                  exploring the outdoors. Whether it’s hiking through National
                  Parks like Yosemite and Sequoia, relaxing at the beach, or
                  discovering new trails, I love experiencing nature whenever I
                  can. I’m also passionate about fitness and working out, seeing
                  it as both a challenge and a way to stay balanced and healthy.{" "}
                  <br></br>
                  Another fun fact about me—I speak three languages: English,
                  Spanish, and Japanese! Learning new languages has given me a
                  deeper appreciation for different cultures and perspectives,
                  and I enjoy finding new ways to connect with people through
                  language and shared experiences.
                  <br />I believe in continuous learning and pushing creative
                  boundaries, whether in music, technology, or personal growth.
